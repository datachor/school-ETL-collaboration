# school-ETL-collaboration
Extracting, transforming and loading STEM school data

A fun project to showcase the ability to pull data out of a database, do some magic, and put it back in!

We got a third/halfway through the project and was able to get a rough entry of some of the data back into the database.

We listed the todos in at the bottom of the page.
